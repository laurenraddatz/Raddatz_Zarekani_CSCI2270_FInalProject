# CSCI2270 Final Project: Tournament of the Gods

# Project Summary
Our project will simulate a mythological tournament. We will read in a text document of different Gods complete with their attributes. The player will pick a God to play. They will have a small amount of influence over their champion. The rest of the fights will be settled automatically. After each round, a new level of a tree will be created. This tree will be created from the bottom up. At the end of the tournament we will be able to traverse the tree and see the result of each fight.

# How to Run
With Tournament.cpp and Tournament.h in the same directory as main.cpp and gods.txt, main.cpp can be run to start the start the game. It must be run using C++11 or higher. To have Code::Blocks use C++11, follow [this] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18174988/how-can-i-add-c11-support-to-codeblocks-compiler) guide.
